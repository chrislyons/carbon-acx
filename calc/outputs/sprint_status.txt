[Summary]
build_id: 7e4af6717ca0
dataset_version: v1.2
tests_passed: False

[Missing Deliverables]
- calc/outputs/audit_report.csv
- dist/artifacts/manifests/ (expected manifest JSON payloads)
- dist/artifacts/figures/ (no rendered figures)
- dist/artifacts/references/ (should mirror calc/outputs/sources_archive)

[Duplicate or Orphaned Entries]
- data/activity_schedule.csv references CONF.HD.PER_PARTICIPANT_HOUR, which is absent from data/activities.csv
- data/emission_factors.csv contains duplicate activity/layer/region combinations for clothing wear-and-tear factors and TRAN.DELIVERY.TRUCK.CLASS6.KM
- calc/outputs/seeding_log.txt has no resolvable linkage to audit outcomes because calc/outputs/audit_report.csv is missing

[Omissions or Empty Tables]
- data/sectors.csv is missing entirely; sector enumeration cannot be validated
- calc/outputs/validation_summary.txt omits the required "tests_passed: True" indicator
- data/profiles.csv columns grid_mix_json and cohort_id are empty for all rows

[Citation Discrepancies]
- data/sources.csv defines 63 unique source_id values but calc/outputs/references_master.txt only lists 55 citations
- calc/outputs/references_master.txt duplicates every URL, violating the uniqueness requirement for references

[Sector Mismatches]
- data/activities.csv, data/emission_factors.csv, and data/profiles.csv lack sector_id columns despite schema mandate
- dist/artifacts/manifest.json contains no artifact entries tied to sectors, preventing sector crosswalk validation

[Overall Verdict]
FAILED
