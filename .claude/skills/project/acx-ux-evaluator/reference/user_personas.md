## Anti-Personas (Who We're NOT Designing For)

### NOT: Academic Researchers
- **Why:** Need raw LCA data, peer-reviewed sources, statistical models
- **Different Needs:** Research tools, API access, bulk data downloads
- **Implication:** Don't prioritize academic features over business needs

### NOT: Individual Consumers
- **Why:** Need personal carbon footprints, lifestyle tips
- **Different Needs:** Mobile apps, gamification, social sharing
- **Implication:** Focus on business/org use cases, not consumer apps

### NOT: Policy Makers / Regulators
- **Why:** Need aggregate data, policy modeling, compliance enforcement
- **Different Needs:** Anonymized datasets, regulatory reporting, enforcement tools
- **Implication:** Support compliance output but don't build enforcement features
