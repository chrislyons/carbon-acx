## How Skills Work

Skills provide passive guidance as you work. They don't execute tasks automaticallyâ€”they help you understand requirements and validate your work in real-time.

**Think of skills as expert advisors sitting next to you while you code.**

For automated task execution, use **Agents** (see `.claude/agents/`).
