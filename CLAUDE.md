# CLAUDE.md - Claude Code Context for Carbon ACX

## Purpose
This document provides context and guidance for Claude Code when working with the Carbon ACX repository. It complements the general AI assistant guidelines in AGENTS.md with Claude-specific information.

---

## Repository Overview

Carbon ACX is an open reference stack for trustworthy carbon accounting that transforms auditable CSV inputs into reproducible datasets and delivers disclosures through multiple interfaces (Dash, React, Cloudflare).

**Key principle:** Manifest-first architecture where every chart, catalogue, and disclosure includes byte hashes, schema versions, and provenance for downstream trust.

---

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Data Layer (`data/`)
- **Activities, emission factors, schedules, grid intensity** stored as canonical CSVs
- Source of truth for all carbon accounting calculations
- Schema evolution tracked through Git history
- Files: `activities.csv`, `layers.csv`, `icons.csv`, etc.

### 2. Derivation Engine (`calc/`)
- **Python 3.11+** with Pydantic schemas, Poetry for dependencies
- `calc/derive.py` is the main entry point (run via `make build`)
- Validates inputs, computes emissions, exports intensity matrices
- Generates immutable manifests with hashed figures in `dist/artifacts/<hash>/`
- **Pattern:** Keep validation, figure generation, references in same code path

### 3. User Interfaces

#### Dash Operations Client (`app/`)
- Analyst-focused Python Dash application
- Agency breakdowns, scenario toggles, provenance-aware references
- Reads from `calc/outputs` or `ACX_ARTIFACT_DIR`
- Launch with `make app`

#### Modern Web Application (`apps/carbon-acx-web/`)
- **Next-generation interface** built with React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite 5 build system, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- Part of pnpm workspace monorepo structure
- Tests: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)
- Run: `pnpm dev` from root or `npm run dev` in app directory

#### Static React Site (`site/`)
- Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS
- Mirrors Dash workflow for marketing/investor portals
- Reads same manifest catalogue as other interfaces
- WebGPU local chat feature (`@mlc-ai/web-llm`)
- Launch: `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` in `site/`

### 4. Edge Delivery

#### Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/`)
- Proxies artifact access with immutable caching
- Sanitized paths, optional upstream origins
- File: `functions/carbon-acx/[[path]].ts`

#### Cloudflare Worker API (`workers/`)
- `/api/compute` and `/api/health` endpoints
- On-demand calculations with strict input validation
- Configuration: `wrangler.toml`
- Deploy: `wrangler dev` (local) or `wrangler deploy`

## Key Workflows

### Building the Dataset
```bash
make build                    # Full derivation pipeline
python -m calc.derive         # Direct invocation
make build-backend            # Use SQLite backend (ACX_DATA_BACKEND)
```

### Running User Interfaces
```bash
make app                      # Dash application
pnpm dev                      # Modern web app (apps/carbon-acx-web)
cd site && npm run dev        # Static React site
```

### Testing
```bash
make validate                 # Runs all checks (Ruff, Black, pytest, linters)
pytest tests/                 # Python tests
pnpm test                     # JavaScript tests in workspaces
```

### Packaging & Deployment
```bash
make package                  # Assembles dist/site with artifacts, headers, redirects
wrangler deploy               # Deploy Worker API
```

---

## File Organization Conventions

### Path References
When referencing code locations, use the pattern: `file_path:line_number`
- Example: "Error handling occurs in `calc/derive.py:712`"

### Important Directories
- `calc/` - Core derivation engine
- `app/` - Dash analytics interface
- `apps/` - Workspace applications (pnpm monorepo)
- `site/` - Static React interface
- `data/` - Source CSV files
- `scripts/` - Maintenance utilities
- `docs/` - Extended documentation
- `tests/` - Python test suite
- `dist/` - Build outputs and artifacts
- `functions/` - Cloudflare Pages functions
- `workers/` - Cloudflare Worker source

---

## Working with Claude Code

### Read First, Then Edit
- Always read files before editing them
- Use Read tool for file inspection
- Use Edit tool for precise changes
- Use Glob/Grep for searching when location is uncertain

### Common Tasks

**Adding a new layer:**
1. Update `data/layers.csv` with new layer definition
2. Add emission factors to `data/emission_factors.csv`
3. Update activity mappings as needed
4. Run `make build` to regenerate artifacts
5. Update tests in `tests/` to cover new layer

**Modifying the derivation pipeline:**
1. Read `calc/derive.py` to understand current flow
2. Update Pydantic schemas in `calc/` if data structures change
3. Maintain manifest integrity and figure generation
4. Run `pytest tests/` to verify changes
5. Update documentation if API changes

**UI changes:**
1. For modern interface: work in `apps/carbon-acx-web/`
2. For legacy interface: work in `site/`
3. For analytics: work in `app/`
4. Follow existing component patterns
5. Run relevant tests (Vitest, Playwright, or manual Dash testing)

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing lint/format/test scripts
- Python: Black + Ruff with 100 character line length
- TypeScript: Follow project's tsconfig.json settings
- Prefer small, cohesive changes with clear rationale
- Include tests for non-trivial functionality
- Add docstrings/JSDoc for complex functions

---

## Security & Secrets

**Never expose:**
- API tokens or credentials in code
- Production data in prompts or commits
- Environment variables (use `.env` files, not committed)

**Storage locations:**
- Local dev: `.env` files (gitignored)
- GitHub CI: Repository Settings â†’ Secrets
- Cloudflare Workers: `wrangler secret put <NAME>`

---

## Important Constraints

### Runtime Constraints
- Cloudflare Workers have edge runtime limitations (no Node.js APIs)
- Specify runtime constraints when modifying Worker code
- Include binding names for resources (KV, R2, D1, Queues)

### Repository Constraints
- **No binary files** in commits
- Avoid the contiguous token "F a s t A P I" in docs (hygiene check)
- Changes to `wrangler.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `Makefile` are high-risk
- All AI-generated changes require human review
- Use `ai-generated` PR label and `Generated-by: claude-code` commit footer

### Dependency Management
- Propose dependency updates separately from feature work
- Justify new packages (license, size, maintenance status)
- Document lockfile update commands in PRs
- Python: `poetry add <package>`
- JavaScript: `pnpm add <package>` (workspace-aware)

## Monorepo Structure

This repository uses **pnpm workspaces** for JavaScript packages:

```
package.json              # Root workspace config
pnpm-workspace.yaml       # Workspace package definitions
apps/
  carbon-acx-web/         # Modern web application
    package.json
site/                     # Legacy static site (separate package)
  package.json
```

When working with JavaScript:
- Run commands from root: `pnpm --filter carbon-acx-web dev`
- Or within app directory: `cd apps/carbon-acx-web && npm run dev`
- Shared dependencies hoisted to root `node_modules/`

---

## Dataset Versioning

Current dataset version tracked in: `calc/outputs/sprint_status.txt`

When updating data:
- Maintain provenance through commit messages
- Update references and citations synchronously
- Re-run derivation pipeline to update manifests
- Verify integrity checks pass

## Tips for Effective Assistance

1. **Start with context:** Read README.md and relevant source files first
2. **Follow patterns:** Match existing code style and architecture
3. **Test thoroughly:** Run appropriate test suites before completing tasks
4. **Document changes:** Update docs when modifying interfaces or data schemas
5. **Small iterations:** Prefer incremental changes over large refactors
