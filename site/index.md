# Carbon ACX emissions overview

> **Disclosure (ACX009).** Carbon ACX prototypes summarise precomputed emissions
> estimates. The Dash preview and static client both read the immutable
> `calc/outputs` bundle generated by `make build`. No live data collection or API
> calls occur at runtime. Refer to the `calc/outputs/manifest.json` file for the
> snapshot timestamp and scope of coverage.

The production copy should match the bundled static page produced by
`scripts.build_site`:

- **Hero title:** `Carbon ACX emissions overview`
- **Hero subtitle:** `Figures sourced from precomputed artifacts. Hover a chart to see supporting references.`
- **Generated at notice:** Use the timestamp embedded in `calc/outputs/manifest.json` when present.
- **Chart sections:**
  - `Annual emissions by activity category`
  - `Activity bubble chart`
  - `Activity flow`
- **Sidebar title:** `References`
- **Sidebar body:** Render the IEEE-formatted entries from
  `calc/outputs/references/{stacked,bubble,sankey}_refs.txt` followed by the
  dataset manifest summary.

## Reference handling

All references originate from the derived artifact bundle and are expressed in
IEEE format. Cloudflare Pages publishes the static `build/site/index.html`
artifact, while the Dash preview mirrors the same references via
`calc/outputs/references/export_view_refs.txt`. Never hand-edit citation text;
regenerate artifacts if new sources are needed.
