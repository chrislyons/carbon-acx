> **Disclosure (ACX009).** Carbon ACX prototypes summarise precomputed emissions estimates. The Dash preview and Cloudflare Pages client both read the immutable ``calc/outputs`` bundle generated by ``make build``, including the prebuilt Plotly JSON in ``calc/outputs/figures/*.json`` and IEEE references in ``calc/outputs/references/*_refs.txt``. No live data collection or API calls occur at runtime. Refer to the ``calc/outputs/manifest.json`` file for the snapshot timestamp and scope of coverage.
