**Acceptance:** embodied footprint visible for weapons production.

***

## **CDX056 — Bases & Infrastructure**

**Title:** data(seed): add military bases as energy-intensive facilities

**Intent:** Treat military bases as industrial facilities — massive building/energy footprints.

**Do**

1. **Entities:** NATO, Canadian Forces Base (Trenton).
2. **Activities:**

```javascript
MIL.BASE.M2.YEAR,"Military base (m2-year)","Operational footprint of base facilities"

```

2. 
3. **FUs:** FU.M2YEAR.
4. **Emission Factors (U.S. DoD inventory, UK MoD reports):**
    - Military base: 120–180 kgCO₂e/m²-year.
    - Munitions depot: ~200–250 kgCO₂e/m²-year.

***

## **CDX057 — War & Conflict Operations (Modeled Events)**

**Title:** data(seed): add modeled scenarios for military campaigns

**Intent:** Enable “conflict scenario” profiles: e.g. a year of war in region X.

**Do**

1. **Activities:**

```javascript
MIL.CONFLICT.MONTH,"Armed conflict (month)","Average operational footprint per month of active war"
```

1. 
2. **FUs:** FU.MONTH.
3. **Emission Factors (UNEP / Conflict & Environment Observatory):**
    - ~1–2 MtCO₂e/month for high-intensity conflicts (Iraq War, Afghanistan).
4. **Schedules:**
    - PROFILE.WAR.UKRAINE.2022 — conflict activity rows spanning months.

**Acceptance:** intensity shows modeled conflict footprints, orders of magnitude larger than civilians.

***

## **CDX058 — Upstream Defense Supply Chains**

**Title:** data(seed): add steel, aluminum, explosives precursors used for defense

**Intent:** Expose indirect military emissions (supply chains).

**Do**

- Link to **Materials sector (CDX037)**: steel, aluminum.
- Add **chemicals**: TNT, RDX, ammonium nitrate.
- Activities:

```javascript
CHEM.TNT.TONNE,"TNT explosive production (t)"
CHEM.RDX.TONNE,"RDX explosive production (t)"
```

- 
- Emission factors: explosives ~5–7 tCO₂e/t produced.

**Acceptance:** dependency map shows munitions ops drawing on steel, aluminum, explosives production.

Right — makes sense. If the prism is going to compare **agency budgets**, then even the “micro-military” (private guards, security details, gated communities) belongs in there as a **layer**, not just a footnote. That way you can show how *“1 private security convoy”* scales against *“1 family commute”* or *“1 hospital floor’s electricity.”*

Here’s how I’d structure it:

***

## **CDX059 — Personal Security Details Layer**

**Title:** data(seed): add personal/private security entities, ops, and emission factors

**Intent:** Capture the footprint of private security and protective services — armored SUVs, armed guards, surveillance gear — as a distinct **layer**. Civilian choice here is almost nil; it’s driven by wealth concentration, corporate policy, and state outsourcing.

***

### **1. Entities**

- ENTITY.BLACKWATER.US (as archetype / private military contractor)

- ENTITY.PRIVSEC.ELITE (placeholder for high-net-worth personal security services)

- Helicopter patrol: ~250–400 kgCO₂e/hour (jet fuel burn, IEA aviation factors).

Sources:

- IPCC 2019 Refinement (vehicle intensity).
- NRCAN vehicle energy intensity survey.
