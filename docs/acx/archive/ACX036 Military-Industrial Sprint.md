***

## **CDX057 ‚Äî War & Conflict Operations (Modeled Events)**

**Title:** data(seed): add modeled scenarios for military campaigns

**Intent:** Enable ‚Äúconflict scenario‚Äù profiles: e.g. a year of war in region X.

**Do**

1. **Activities:**

```javascript
MIL.CONFLICT.MONTH,"Armed conflict (month)","Average operational footprint per month of active war"
```

1. 
2. **FUs:** FU.MONTH.

    - PROFILE.WAR.UKRAINE.2022 ‚Äî conflict activity rows spanning months.

**Acceptance:** intensity shows modeled conflict footprints, orders of magnitude larger than civilians.

***

## **CDX058 ‚Äî Upstream Defense Supply Chains**

**Title:** data(seed): add steel, aluminum, explosives precursors used for defense

**Intent:** Expose indirect military emissions (supply chains).

**Do**

- Link to **Materials sector (CDX037)**: steel, aluminum.
- Add **chemicals**: TNT, RDX, ammonium nitrate.
- Activities:

```javascript
CHEM.TNT.TONNE,"TNT explosive production (t)"
CHEM.RDX.TONNE,"RDX explosive production (t)"
```

- 
- Emission factors: explosives ~5‚Äì7 tCO‚ÇÇe/t produced.

**Acceptance:** dependency map shows munitions ops drawing on steel, aluminum, explosives production.

***

Right ‚Äî makes sense. If the prism is going to compare **agency budgets**, then even the ‚Äúmicro-military‚Äù (private guards, security details, gated communities) belongs in there as a **layer**, not just a footnote. That way you can show how *‚Äú1 private security convoy‚Äù* scales against *‚Äú1 family commute‚Äù* or *‚Äú1 hospital floor‚Äôs electricity.‚Äù*

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd structure it:

***

## **CDX059 ‚Äî Personal Security Details Layer**

**Title:** data(seed): add personal/private security entities, ops, and emission factors

**Intent:** Capture the footprint of private security and protective services ‚Äî armored SUVs, armed guards, surveillance gear ‚Äî as a distinct **layer**. Civilian choice here is almost nil; it‚Äôs driven by wealth concentration, corporate policy, and state outsourcing.
