Excellent ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **‚ÄúFlights, Fridges, and ‚Ä¶‚Äù sprint**. I‚Äôve broken it into clean Codex Cloud prompts (CDX049‚ÄìCDX053). Each is scoped to seed overlooked systemic sectors with **entities ‚Üí sites ‚Üí assets ‚Üí operations**, plus **activities, FUs, and citable emission factors**. This way, they plug straight into your industry-first backbone (CDX036 onward).

# **‚úÖ Sprint Summary**

- **CDX049 Flights:** passenger aviation (short/long-haul, private).
- **CDX050 Fridges:** appliances & cold chain.
- **CDX051 Fabrics:** embodied electronics/devices.
- **CDX052 Freight:** maritime shipping.
- **CDX053 Facilities:** building operations & healthcare.

Together these capture the **overlooked systems** that consumers can‚Äôt directly control but that dominate emissions. They‚Äôll slot cleanly into your industry-first backbone, with civilian habits later mapped to them (e.g., ‚Äúown a smartphone‚Äù ‚Üí DEVICE.SMARTPHONE.UNIT, ‚Äúfly to New York‚Äù ‚Üí TRAN.FLIGHT.SHORTHAUL.PKM).

***

üëâ Do you want me to also draft a **CDX054** for a *unified ‚ÄúOverlooked Systems‚Äù tab* in the UI (Flights, Fridges, Fabrics, Freight, Facilities grouped under one toggle), or should these just blend into their industry categories for now?
