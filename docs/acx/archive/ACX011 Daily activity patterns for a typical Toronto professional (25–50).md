# ACX011 Daily activity patterns for a typical Toronto professional (25–50)

**Context anchor.** Roughly a quarter of workers in the Toronto census metro area work from home on a given day, so daily patterns split between at-home and office days [1].

## Food & diet

- **Coffee first.** Most adults have coffee daily; nationally, 74% reported having “a coffee yesterday.” Cost pressure is cutting café purchases (54% reducing them) and eating out/takeout (64% reducing) [10].
- **Breakfast.** At home: toast/eggs/oatmeal; on the go: café pastry + drip or latte (see coffee figures above) [10].
- **Lunch.** Office days: quick-service near the office or reheated meal-prep; WFH days: leftovers, sandwich/salad. About a third of Canadians now order takeout at least weekly, which often substitutes for lunch or dinner [11].
- **Dinner.** Weeknights skew to cooking (cost control); end-week a delivery order (~$30–35 median per order in Canada) is common [14].
- **Hydration/snacks.** Refill bottle at work or gym; mid-afternoon coffee/tea.
- **Payments.** Tap-to-pay dominates in-person food spend; contactless (card/phone/watch) accounts for most in-store transactions, and mobile-wallet use is frequent (about half use a mobile wallet 3–5×/week) [12], [13].

## Travel & transit

- **Commute frequency.** Hybrid workers travel 2–3 days/week; others commute daily.
- **Modes.** City of Toronto workers’ primary modes skew to transit (≈26%), car (driver or passenger), walking and cycling; shares vary by neighborhood and hybrid schedule [3].
- **Door-to-door times.** Typical one-way durations in the Toronto CMA: car ≈25–30 min; transit ≈45–50 min; cycling/walking typically shorter for <7 km trips [2].
- **TTC usage habits.** Riders tap with PRESTO, or now directly with debit/credit/phone; fare includes a two-hour transfer window, which shapes errand chaining after work [4], [5].
- **Ride-hailing.** Uber/Lyft fill late-evening, cross-town, and “first/last-mile” gaps; regulated vehicles account for ~212k trips/day citywide (≈14% of downtown traffic by late evening), so occasional use is common even among transit riders [6].
- **Cycling.** Fair-weather commuting and short hops via personal bikes or Bike Share are mainstream; Bike Share set a 35,000 rides/day record in 2024 and usage continues to grow alongside new bikeways [7], [8].
- **E-scooters.** Still not permitted on public roads/paths in Toronto, so they do not feature in daily mobility patterns [9].

## Online habits & media consumption

- **Always-connected.** Internet use is near-universal (≈94% of population), and ≈82% of Canadians use social platforms; usage estimates commonly inform “micro-checks” throughout the day [15].
- **Social media time.** Canadians spend roughly ~1 h 53 m/day on social media across apps, typically in short sessions (morning, lunch, transit, late evening) [16].
- **Video & TV.** Canadians average ≈3 h 25 m/day across streaming + linear TV; evenings often include 1–2 streaming episodes or sports/news [17]. Households typically maintain ~2–3 paid video subscriptions (often shared) [18].
- **News.** Mix of push alerts, radio in car/transit, and evening TV/CTV/CP24/CBC apps; consumption leans digital and app-based on weekdays (supported by the same adoption/time-spent datasets cited above) [15]–[18].
- **Audio.** Weekday podcasts/music during commute/gym; platform choice aligns with broader social/mobile adoption [15], [16].

## Lifestyle & leisure

- **Exercise.** Quick sessions before work or after (weights/cardio classes) 2–4×/week; weekend longer run/ride when weather allows (cycling infrastructure expansion supports recreational riding) [8].
- **Parks & micro-leisure.** Coffee walks, dog walks, and park meet-ups after work from May–October; winter shifts to indoor cafés, gyms, and rinks.
- **Errands.** Groceries 1–2×/week; pharmacy/convenience top-ups mid-week; package pickup/returns folded into commute using the TTC two-hour window [5].
- **Social.** After-work drink mid-week; dinner with friends/family Fri–Sun; occasional event (concert, sports).

## Consumer micro-spend (“meaningless purchases”)

- **Café purchases.** Habit coffee/tea and small snacks are the most frequent daily discretionary buys; many report trimming frequency or switching to at-home brew [10].
- **Tap-first micro-transactions.** High tap adoption makes <$20 “frictionless” spends routine (coffee, snacks, transit top-ups) [12], [13].
- **Food-ordering fees & upsells.** Weekly delivery orders carry service/delivery fees; app nudges (add-ons, tips) raise ticket size to the ~$30 range [11], [14].
- **Subscription creep.** Canadians systematically underestimate recurring subscriptions (media, apps, cloud storage, fitness); surveys find averages near eight active subscriptions per person (many low-value) [19].
- **Gaming/lottery.** Small recurring spends (Lotto/INSTANT, sports pools) persist; historically, “games of chance” capture ≈4–5% of Ontario household disposable outlays across casino/lottery/online—small daily tickets add up at scale [21].

## Workday digital patterns

- **Messaging/meetings.** Teams/Slack pings in bursts around meetings; short mobile checks during transit and between tasks.
- **Utilities.** Routine Interac e-Transfers, calendar edits, and map lookups; mobile wallets used multiple times per week [12].
- **Micro-learning/scroll.** 5–10 minute news, Reddit, X, TikTok, IG Reels during breaks; longer YouTube/watch-later in the evening [15]–[17].
