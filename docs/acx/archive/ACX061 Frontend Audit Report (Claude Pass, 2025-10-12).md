# Repository Audit - October 12, 2025

**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Scope:** Complete repository structure, configuration, documentation, and code quality

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of the Carbon ACX repository revealed 8 gaps ranging from critical security issues to low-priority developer convenience enhancements. The repository is generally well-structured with:
- ✅ 47 Python test files with good coverage
- ✅ All Makefile dependencies present
- ✅ Valid configuration files and CI/CD setup
- ✅ Clean codebase (no TODO/FIXME markers in source)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation structure

**Critical Issues:** 1
**High Priority:** 2
**Medium Priority:** 3
**Low Priority:** 2

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Security Gap: Missing .env in .gitignore
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** HIGH
**Risk:** Accidental commit of sensitive credentials
**Location:** `.gitignore`

**Finding:**
The `.gitignore` file does not explicitly ignore `.env` files. While AGENTS.md (line 33) and CLAUDE.md mention using `.env` for local development secrets, there is no protection against accidentally committing these files.

**Evidence:**
- AGENTS.md line 33: "Local dev: .env (never committed)"
- CLAUDE.md mentions `.env` files should never be committed
- Current `.gitignore` does not include `.env` or `.env.*` patterns

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (developers commonly use .env files)
- **Impact:** High (credential exposure, security breach)
- **CVSS-like severity:** 7.5/10

**Recommendation:**
Add the following to `.gitignore`:
```
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

## High Priority Gaps

### 2. Missing .env.example Template
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Developer Experience, Security
**Location:** Root directory

**Finding:**
No template file exists to document required environment variables. The Makefile and documentation reference several environment variables that are undocumented for new developers.

**Evidence:**
- Makefile uses: `ACX_DATA_BACKEND`, `ACX_OUTPUT_ROOT`, `ACX_GENERATED_AT`, `ACX_ARTIFACT_DIR`
- site/vite.config.ts uses: `PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`
- No centralized documentation of these variables

**Impact:**
- New developers unclear about configuration options
- Inconsistent local development setups
- Potential misconfiguration leading to bugs

**Recommendation:**
Create `.env.example` documenting all environment variables with:
- Variable name
- Purpose/description
- Default value
- Example value
- Required vs optional status

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

### 3. Outdated Documentation: WHAT_RUNS_WHERE.md
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Documentation Accuracy
**Location:** `docs/WHAT_RUNS_WHERE.md`

**Finding:**
Documentation references obsolete path structure that no longer exists in the repository.

**Evidence:**
- Line 5 references: `build/<backend>/calc/outputs`
- Makefile actually uses: `dist/artifacts/<backend>`
- The `build/` directory does not exist in current repository structure
- All current references use `dist/` as the output directory

**Impact:**
- Developers following docs will fail to find artifacts
- Confusion about build output locations
- Wasted time debugging incorrect paths

**Recommendation:**
Update all path references in WHAT_RUNS_WHERE.md to reflect current structure:
- `build/<backend>/calc/outputs` → `dist/artifacts/<backend>`
- Verify all other path references in the document

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

## Medium Priority Gaps

### 4. Missing apps/carbon-acx-web/README.md
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Documentation, Architecture Clarity
**Location:** `apps/carbon-acx-web/`

**Finding:**
The new modern web application (`apps/carbon-acx-web/`) lacks dedicated documentation explaining its purpose, architecture, and relationship to other interfaces.

**Evidence:**
- Root README.md mentions the apps/ directory but doesn't detail the architecture
- No local README.md in the app directory
- Developers must infer purpose from package.json and source code
- Unclear when to use this vs `site/` vs `app/` (Dash)

**Impact:**
- Confusion about which interface to work on
- Unclear development setup specific to this app
- Missing context on architectural decisions
- Harder onboarding for new contributors

**Recommendation:**
Create `apps/carbon-acx-web/README.md` covering:
- Purpose and scope of this application
- How it differs from `site/` (legacy) and `app/` (Dash)
- Technology stack (React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind, Radix UI)
- Development workflow
- Testing approach (Vitest + Playwright)
- Build and deployment process

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

### 5. Missing site/README.md
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Documentation, Legacy Code Management
**Location:** `site/`

**Finding:**
The `site/` directory (legacy static React interface) lacks documentation clarifying its status and relationship to the new `apps/carbon-acx-web/` application.

**Evidence:**
- CLAUDE.md refers to site/ as "legacy interface" (line 201, 339)
- No documentation in site/ directory itself explaining this status
- Unclear deprecation timeline or migration plan
- 25 test files suggest active maintenance

**Impact:**
- Developers unclear whether to maintain or migrate away
- Risk of duplicate work across old and new interfaces
- Unclear which interface to use for new features

**Recommendation:**
Create `site/README.md` explaining:
- Legacy status and reasons for new app
- Current maintenance mode (security fixes only? feature parity?)
- Migration timeline if planned
- When this interface is still appropriate to use
- Relationship to `apps/carbon-acx-web/`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

### 6. Insufficient Test Coverage for New App
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Quality Assurance
**Location:** `apps/carbon-acx-web/`

**Finding:**
The new modern web application has significantly lower test coverage compared to the legacy interface.

**Evidence:**
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/`: 2 test files
- `site/`: 25 test files
- Legacy interface has ~12x more test files
- New app is receiving active development but minimal testing

**Metrics:**
```
Python tests:     47 files (good coverage)
Site tests:       25 files (legacy interface)
New app tests:    2 files (insufficient)
```

**Impact:**
- Higher risk of regressions in new application
- Less confidence in refactoring
- Potential production bugs
- Technical debt accumulation

**Recommendation:**
Expand test suite for `apps/carbon-acx-web/` to include:
- Component unit tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Integration tests for data fetching and state management
- E2E tests for critical user flows (Playwright)
- Target: Match or exceed legacy test coverage percentage

**Priority Rationale:**
Marked as medium priority as immediate fixes focus on security and documentation, but this should be addressed before next major release.

**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED (requires substantial development work beyond quick fixes)

---

## Low Priority Gaps

### 7. Missing .editorconfig
**Priority:** LOW
**Impact:** LOW
**Category:** Code Consistency
**Location:** Root directory

**Finding:**
No EditorConfig file exists to enforce consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs.

**Evidence:**
- Black configured with 100 character line length
- Ruff configured with 100 character line length
- TypeScript projects don't specify consistent indentation/whitespace
- No universal editor configuration

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent whitespace/indentation across contributors
- Potential for style-only diffs in PRs
- Mixed line endings (CRLF vs LF)
- Different indentation styles (tabs vs spaces)

**Benefits of Adding:**
- Automatic configuration for most editors
- Reduces style-related PR discussions
- Consistent formatting without manual configuration
- Works alongside Black, Ruff, and Prettier

**Recommendation:**
Create `.editorconfig` with:
```ini
root = true

[*]
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.{py,pyx}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
max_line_length = 100

[*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,yaml,yml}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)

---

### 8. Missing .nvmrc
**Priority:** LOW
**Impact:** LOW
**Category:** Developer Convenience
**Location:** Root directory

**Finding:**
No `.nvmrc` file exists for automatic Node.js version management, despite specifying version in package.json.

**Evidence:**
- `package.json` specifies: `"node": "20.19.4"`
- Many developers use nvm for Node version management
- No `.nvmrc` for automatic version switching

**Impact:**
- Manual version switching required
- Potential for running wrong Node version locally
- Inconsistent Node versions across development environments

**Benefits of Adding:**
- Automatic version switching with `nvm use`
- Auto-switching on directory entry (with shell integration)
- Clear version requirement for developers not reading package.json

**Recommendation:**
Create `.nvmrc` with content: `20.19.4`

**Priority Rationale:**
Low priority as Node version is already documented in package.json and enforced by pnpm's engine requirement. This is purely a convenience enhancement.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-12)
