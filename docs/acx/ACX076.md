# Carbon ACX Dark Mode Refinement and UX Polish

Comprehensive dark mode fixes and Skip button refinement for the new onboarding wizard.

## Context

Following the successful merge of PR #236 (ACX075 - Comprehensive UX Improvements), the deployed preview revealed critical dark mode readability issues. The new dark forest green theme had hard-coded light colors in nested UI components that became unreadable in dark mode. Additionally, the Skip button in the onboarding wizard had poor spacing and an unattractive focus state.

**User Feedback:** "Practically everything in the new start wizard was unreadable because of dark mode."

## Work Completed

### 1. Dark Mode Readability Audit & Fixes

**Problem:** Hard-coded light background colors (`bg-white`, `bg-surface-elevated`, light blue/green/amber boxes) were too bright in dark mode, creating poor contrast and eye strain.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/styles/tokens.css` - Forest green theme (previously fixed in PR #236)
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/OnboardingWizard.tsx` - Nested info boxes
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/QuickCalculator.tsx` - All UI elements
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/ActivityBadgeGrid.tsx` - Guidance banner
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/views/SectorView.tsx` - Help section
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/views/DashboardView.tsx` - Comparison cards + delete buttons
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/LayerToggle.tsx` - Delete button + footer
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/LayerManager.tsx` - Delete button
- `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/views/NavSidebar.tsx` - Delete button in layers view

**Pattern Applied:**
```tsx
// Light backgrounds
bg-blue-50 → bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20
border-blue-200 → border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800/30

// Text colors
text-green-600 → text-green-600 dark:text-green-400

// Nested boxes (too bright)
bg-white dark:bg-surface-elevated → bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800/50

// Delete buttons
text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50 → text-red-600 dark:text-red-400 hover:bg-red-50 dark:hover:bg-red-900/20
```

**Components Fixed:**

1. **OnboardingWizard.tsx** - DetailedStep2 nested callout boxes
   - "You'll see activities sorted by carbon intensity" info box
   - "Activity Selected" example badge
   - Changed from `bg-surface-elevated` to `bg-neutral-800/50` in dark mode

2. **QuickCalculator.tsx** - All interactive elements
   - Selected state backgrounds (diet/energy/shopping buttons)
   - Icon backgrounds in question headers
   - Results gradient card
   - Stats boxes (global average, comparison)
   - Info box with lightbulb

3. **Delete Buttons** (4 components)
   - Changed red text from `600` → `400` in dark mode
   - Changed red backgrounds from `50` → `900/20` in dark mode
   - Applied to LayerToggle, LayerManager, NavSidebar, DashboardView

### 2. Skip Button Refinement

**Problem:** Skip button in onboarding wizard had poor spacing (flush against edge) and harsh green focus ring.

**File Modified:** `apps/carbon-acx-web/src/components/OnboardingWizard.tsx`

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  onClick={handleSkip}
  className="mr-2 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-accent-500/50 focus-visible:ring-offset-2"
>
  Skip
</Button>
```

**Changes:**
- Added `mr-2` (8px right margin) for breathing room
- Replaced harsh focus state with softer `ring-accent-500/50` (semi-transparent)
- Added `ring-offset-2` for better visual separation

## Technical Decisions

### Why `neutral-800/50` Instead of `surface-elevated`?

**Problem:** `surface-elevated` = `rgba(21, 30, 26, 0.92)` was too bright/opaque in dark forest green theme.

**Solution:** `neutral-800/50` provides:
- Better visual harmony with dark forest green background
- Semi-transparent (50%) allows theme color to show through
- Softer contrast while maintaining readability
- Consistent with other dark mode callout boxes

### Dark Mode Color Strategy

**Principle:** In dark mode, reduce brightness and increase opacity for nested elements.

**Pattern:**
- Level 1 (main background): `surface-background` (#0a0f0d)
- Level 2 (cards): `surface` (#0f1613)
- Level 3 (nested boxes): `neutral-800/50` or `blue-900/20`
- Text: Lighten by 200-400 units (e.g., `600` → `400`)
